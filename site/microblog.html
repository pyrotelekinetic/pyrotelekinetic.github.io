		<p>
			One can easily view older commits of pyrosite. However, there is
			currently no way to view any commit but the latest in rendered form.
		</p>
		<p>
			What if I had nix build pyrosite at every commit, and place them in
			subdirectories named by the commit hash? I think this could work.
		</p>
		<p>
			The primary benefit of this is the resulting static urls. Pyrosite pages
			could be linked to at any specified commit, and they would be rendered
			displayed correctly.
